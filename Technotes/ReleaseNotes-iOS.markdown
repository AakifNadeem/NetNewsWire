# iOS Release Notes

### 6.0 TestFlight build 602 - 21 April 2021

Inoreader: don’t call it so often, so we don’t go over the API limits
Feedly: handle a specific case where Feedly started not returning a value we expected but didn’t actually need (we were reporting it as an error to the user, but it wasn’t)
